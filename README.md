Making Recommendation Ayah of Al-Quran with Natural Language Processing

## INTRODUCTION
The Quran also romanized Qor'an or Koran, is the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be a revelation from God. It is organized in 114 chapters(Surah), which consist of verses (ayah). In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in Arabic literature, and has significantly influenced the Arabic language.


But sometimes it is difficult to know the translation of ayah because not all of the muslims can speak in arabic or have a knowledge of the arabic language.
Therefore, this project is built to distinguish the arabic of ayah and get the translations verse and giving a recommendation ayah that relate with the meaning. So we can understand about the ayah although we can't speak in arabic.

## TECHNOLOGIES
